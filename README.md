Some of my Linux configuration files

## Configuration files for kakoune and kitty-terminal

## Custom python script to require a confirmation code when using rm
Place the rm_with_check.py file at a location of your choosing. Then add this command to your .bash_aliases:

> alias rm='python3 /path/to/rm_with_check.py'

## A changed dvorak layout based on 'se'. 
This comes with minial changes. The 'tilde' key now has an tilde on it.
